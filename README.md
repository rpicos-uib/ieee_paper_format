# ieee_paper_format
This bash script adds header and footer to ieee conference papers.

Modifications:

header1 contains the full name of the conference as stated in the letter of acquisition from IEEE:
header1='2022 11th International Conference on Modern Circuits and Systems Technologies (MOCAST)'

footer1 contains the copyright notice, as stated in the letter of acquisition from IEEE:
footer1='978-1-6654-6717-9/22/\$31.00~~\copyright~~2022~~IEEE'

in_directory contains the directory where your papers are stored. I strongly suggest that you run the script from one directory below...

in_directory=papers

The output will then be put in the directory (in_directory)_ieee.
